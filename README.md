# ESPChess
Online MultiThreaded Chess Playing Library for ESP32.

This library has some easy to use c++ API which communicates over an HTTP api. This means that with little code, you can make an arduino play on chess.com.
This library includes some classes which can be initialised to login with your chess account and another one to create a game. 

A better documentation will come soon.

Also: It will soon support a Seven Inch TFT display as soon as my delivery comes :)

My deadline for the TFT screen to work and to have a proper GUI to play chess online (Using the ESP32): 20th June
